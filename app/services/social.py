"""Waypoint: a private progress journal, not a social feed.
 
Generalized to work across all 4 roles, not just candidates. This
used to include connection suggestions and a cross-user feed ranked
by goal relevance. That was cut deliberately: a feed and a connection
system only have real value once there are enough real users for
either to mean something, and a connection feature between real
people carries a genuine moderation/safety workload (spam, fake
profiles, harassment, abuse reports) that isn't worth taking on for a
feature with no real users behind it yet.
 
What's left, and what this file does:
1. reflect_on_journal_entry() - a real, specific reflection on ONE
   entry.
2. reflect_on_entry_pattern() - the more valuable piece: a real
   reflection across SEVERAL recent entries at once. A single-entry
   reflection can only restate what was just written back at the
   person; a pattern across entries can surface something they
   wouldn't have noticed themselves.
 
Both take a generic `focus` (the person's stated goal, whatever they
are hiring for, what they teach - whatever is real for their role)
and `context_summary` (a roadmap summary for candidate/athlete, a
hiring need for business, expertise for tutor) rather than
candidate-specific fields, since this is not candidate-only anymore.

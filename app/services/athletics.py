"""Recruiting content guidance for student-athletes: how to structure
a highlight reel, and which drills/metrics are commonly evaluated for
their specific sport, level, and career direction.
 
generate_recruiting_content_plan() gives grounded GENERAL guidance -
it deliberately never claims to know what a specific named coach or
program wants, since without a real information source that would be
fabrication.
 
research_target_program() is different: it gives Claude the real,
first-party Anthropic web search tool, so it can actually search for
and cite real, current, public information about a SPECIFIC named
program - their recruiting page, coaching staff statements, recent
recruiting classes, roster needs. This is genuinely real search, not
invented knowledge - and it's explicitly instructed to say plainly
when search turns up nothing specific, rather than filling the gap
with a guess.

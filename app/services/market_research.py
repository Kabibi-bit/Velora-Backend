situation - not a generic score, not invented knowledge. Two things
no mainstream job board does:
 
1. research_company() - gives Claude real web search to find and cite
   current, public information about a SPECIFIC company before the
   person applies. Same honest pattern as the athletics program
   research: report only what's actually found, say plainly when
   nothing specific turns up.
 
2. generate_interview_prep() - once someone has a real interview, this
   stitches together the company research, the actual role, and the

    CEO, but the CTO, COO, CPO, and other C-suite or VP-level
    executives - and what they've actually, recently said publicly:
    speeches, interviews, conference talks, posts under their own
    name. Then synthesizes a real, honest sense of what this
    company's leadership actually seems to be prioritizing right now,
    grounded in what multiple real people have actually said, not
    just one CEO's framing (which is often more polished, generic
    company messaging than what other leaders reveal in less

    Never invents a leader, a statement, or a priority; if nothing
    real and current turns up for a given person, or for the company
    at all, this says so plainly rather than filling the gap with a
    plausible-sounding guess. priorities_summary is built ONLY from
    what was actually found - if nothing real turned up, it's empty,
    not a generic assumption about companies like this one.
 
    Paraphrases what's found rather than quoting speeches at length -
    both a copyright concern with someone else's original words, and
    a paraphrased idea reads more naturally in an outreach message
    than a lifted quote would anyway. Mirrors research_company's
    real-search pattern above, including real source-URL extraction
    so a candidate can verify this themselves before sending anything
    grounded in it.

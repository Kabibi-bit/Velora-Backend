"""Real authentication: bcrypt password hashing (never stores or
compares plain-text passwords) and JWT session tokens.
 
Honest scope note: this file, plus the /auth routes built on it, is
a genuinely working login/signup system, and its checks are now
applied across the app - not aspirational. Two enforced patterns:
 
  - require_auth_for_user: the dependency for a route whose own URL
    path carries {user_id}. Every such route uses it (or calls
    verify_token_belongs_to_user directly), so the path user_id is
    always checked against the caller's token - a token can only act
    on its own user's data.
  - verify_token_belongs_to_user(resource.user_id, ...): for a route
    keyed on some OTHER resource's id (an application, outreach,
    post, milestone, etc.), the resource is loaded first and this is
    called with its real owning user_id, so one user can't touch
    another user's resource by guessing its id (no IDOR).
 
The deliberately public, no-token routes are limited to: /auth/signup,
/auth/login, /auth/me (self-scoped - reads only the token's own user),
POST /users (a password-less demo record that can never obtain a token,
so it reaches no protected data), /schools/* (public reference data),
and /engagement/accept/{token} (a cryptographically-random, single-use
capability token IS the authorization). require_valid_token guards the
one authenticated-but-not-owned case (listing leadership research).
 
Keep this note accurate: it is read as the app's security posture. If
a new route is added, wire the matching check above rather than
trusting a URL user_id.

"""Best-effort REAL submission of a web-form job application via a headless
browser (Playwright/Chromium).
 
This is the honest version of "auto-apply to the job site". There is no universal
API to submit an arbitrary employer's application form, so the only real way to do
it is to drive a browser the way a person would. That is genuinely possible for
simple public forms - and genuinely NOT possible for a large share of real
postings (logins, CAPTCHAs, multi-step Workday-style flows, employer accounts).
This module is built to be honest about which case it hit, and - above all - to
NEVER submit a garbled or partial application under the user's name:
 
  Safety model (why this can't silently ruin an application):
    * It aborts (returns "needs_manual") the moment it detects a login/signup
      wall or a CAPTCHA - it does not try to bluff past them.
    * It fills only fields it can confidently map to the user's real data
      (name / email / phone / resume file / cover letter).
    * Before clicking Submit it re-checks EVERY required control on the form.
      If any required field is still empty (i.e. something it couldn't map),
      it aborts instead of submitting an incomplete/garbled application.
    * It only reports "submitted" when it can actually detect a confirmation
      after submitting. No confirmation -> it reports "needs_manual", never a
      fabricated success.
    * If Playwright or a browser binary isn't available in the runtime, it
      returns "unavailable" and the caller falls back to the manual hand-off -
      it never crashes the request.
 
Result status is one of:
    "submitted"    - the form was filled and a submission confirmation was seen.
    "needs_manual" - a real blocker (login/CAPTCHA), an unmappable required
                     field, or no detectable confirmation. Hand off to the user.
    "unavailable"  - no browser automation in this runtime.
    "error"        - an unexpected failure; caller falls back to the hand-off.
 
Deployment note: the deployed backend must have the `playwright` package AND its
Chromium binary installed (`playwright install chromium`). Without them this
returns "unavailable" and the app degrades to the manual hand-off - safe, just
not automatic.

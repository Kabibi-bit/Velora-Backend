"""Two features that are genuinely different from what any competitor
offers, because they require actually being honest about the match
score in the first place:
 
1. Confidence calibration - joins real Outcome records back to the
   Application's confidence_pct at the time it was sent, and reports
   whether high-confidence matches actually convert more often than
   low-confidence ones. Most products show a score and never check
   whether it means anything; this checks, using the user's own
   real results.
 
2. Rejection/ghost autopsy - a real, specific AI comparison of what
   was actually sent against what the listing asked for, instead of
   generic "keep trying" advice.

"""Subscription tiers — the BACKEND source of truth for what Free / Pro / Max grant.
 
Why this exists: gating was frontend-only, which means a Free user was merely
*shown* a locked overlay - the underlying endpoint still ran for anyone with a
token. That makes the tier difference cosmetic, not real. This module lets the
backend actually ENFORCE the tiers, so a paid feature genuinely can't be used
without the tier, regardless of what the client does.
 
Kept deliberately in sync with the frontend TIERS in velora/state.js. A drift
test guards that the feature flags match.
 
No payment yet: a user's tier lives in users.tier (default 'free') and is set
via a switch endpoint for testing. When billing is added, only the SOURCE of the
tier changes (to the verified subscription) - every enforcement point here keeps
working unchanged.

#      generous working limits; Max is effectively unlimited.

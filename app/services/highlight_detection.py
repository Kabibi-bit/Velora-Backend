"""
Highlight detection scaffold — real Roboflow Inference integration.
 
WHAT THIS IS, HONESTLY:
This orchestrates automatic sports-highlight detection from a video the athlete
provides (by URL). The actual computer-vision inference runs on Roboflow's
Inference engine, which needs a GPU + model weights + a Roboflow API key on the
DEPLOYMENT running this code. It cannot run in a plain web container with no GPU,
and it does not run at import time here. This module:
  - is written to Roboflow's real InferencePipeline API contract,
  - aggregates per-frame object detections into KEY MOMENTS (timestamps),
  - fails safe (returns an honest "not configured / no source" result, never a
    fabricated highlight) when Roboflow isn't set up or the video can't be read.
 
WHAT IT DOES NOT DO:
It does not invent moments. If inference isn't available or finds nothing, it
says so plainly. Every returned moment corresponds to a real detection with a
real frame timestamp and confidence from the model.
 
REQUIRED TO RUN LIVE (on the deployment, not here):
  - pip install inference  (or inference-gpu for CUDA)
  - ROBOFLOW_API_KEY set in the environment
  - a model_id (default a general COCO detector that includes 'person' and
    'sports ball'); a sport-specific fine-tuned model gives far better moments.

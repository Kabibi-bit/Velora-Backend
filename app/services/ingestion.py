# there is no free "apply to this scholarship" feed (and pretending otherwise
# would misrepresent how recruiting works). What DOES exist free is the NCAA
# schools list (via a self-hosted henrygd/ncaa-api instance). So we surface real
# college PROGRAMS matched to the athlete's sport/division as "target programs"
# they can pursue via the coach-outreach tool - which is exactly how recruiting
# actually works: get on the radar of the right programs.
#
# Set NCAA_API_BASE to your ncaa-api instance (e.g. https://your-ncaa-api.app or
# http://localhost:3000). If unset, this no-ops cleanly (no crash, no fake data).

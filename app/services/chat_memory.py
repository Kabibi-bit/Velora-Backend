"""Persistent chatbot memory.
 
Note on a design change from the original spec: the schema has a
pgvector `embedding` column for true semantic search, but that needs
a second API account (OpenAI or Voyage) just for embeddings. To get
you running today with only the accounts you already have, this
version retrieves memory by recency instead of similarity - it pulls
your last N remembered facts rather than the N most *relevant* ones.
 
That's a real trade-off: recency-based retrieval will occasionally
surface less-relevant memories than true semantic search would. It's
a reasonable MVP simplification, not a permanent design decision -
swap in real embeddings later by populating the `embedding` column
and switching the query below to `.order_by(ChatMemory.embedding.cosine_distance(...))`.

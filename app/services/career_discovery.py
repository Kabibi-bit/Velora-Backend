"""Career discovery for people who don't yet know what direction to
aim at. Mirrors the frontend's client-side scoring exactly, so the
demo and the real backend behave identically once connected. Unlike
typical career-quiz products, every suggested direction is checked

the deep explanation is a genuine Claude call grounded in the

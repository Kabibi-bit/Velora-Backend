"""Genuine longitudinal career-strategy reasoning - understanding
someone's real, current position and how their actual actions
compound toward a result, rather than scoring one listing at a time
in isolation. Every other AI-calling function in this codebase
reasons about a single listing, a single application, or a single
outcome. Nothing synthesizes across a person's real, accumulated
history to answer the actual question a career platform should be
able to answer: given everything this person has genuinely done so
far, what's the single highest-leverage next move, and why does it
compound rather than just add one more independent task to a list?
 
The real, new risk this introduces that per-listing reasoning doesn't
have: inventing a plausible-sounding connection between two real but
actually-unrelated data points. A model asked to find compounding
connections has a genuine incentive to find one even where none
exists - two applications to unrelated fields can be narrated into a
"strategic thread" that isn't real. The prompt is explicit that a
genuinely disconnected set of actions should be reported as exactly
that, not stitched into a false narrative.

You are synthesizing this person's REAL, accumulated history - not scoring one listing in isolation. Answer these things, grounded ONLY in what's actually here:
 
1. An honest, specific read on where they genuinely stand right now - their real momentum (or lack of it), based on the actual pattern of applications/outcomes/roadmap progress above, not a generic assessment of "early career" or similar. If the real data shows stalled momentum or no clear direction, say that plainly rather than finding false encouragement. Also explicitly check whether their real, actual applications align with their stated goal above - if their real behavior points somewhere genuinely different from what they said they want (e.g. their stated goal is one field but every real application sent is in a different one), name that honestly. This kind of real, checkable mismatch is one of the most valuable things this analysis can surface, so don't let a focus on "momentum" alone cause you to miss it.
 
2. Whether their real actions so far genuinely compound - do any of their actual applications, roadmap progress, saved listings, or real engagement activity build on each other in a real, specific way (e.g. an application to a smaller company in the same real domain as their stated goal genuinely builds real, checkable experience toward a saved listing at a bigger one, or a real, accepted engagement reply to someone at a company connects to a real application or saved listing there)? This must be a REAL, SPECIFIC connection between things that actually appear above - if their actions are genuinely disconnected from each other with no real compounding relationship, say that honestly rather than inventing a narrative thread that isn't there. Do not stitch together two unrelated actions into a false "strategy" - a genuine absence of connection is a real, useful finding, not a failure to find one. A real connection is something that has ALREADY happened - a real outcome, a real shared company, a real skill actually demonstrated in one place that a specific other listing actually requires. It is not two independent, still-pending applications in the same broad field that COULD matter to each other IF a future outcome goes a certain way - "if either produces an offer, it would create leverage" is speculation about a hypothetical future, not a real, existing compounding relationship, even when the underlying field matches. If the only relationship you can point to is that kind of hypothetical, treat it as no genuine connection rather than a real one.
 
3. Given all of the above, ONE specific, highest-leverage next move - not a generic "apply to more listings" but a specific action that genuinely compounds given their real, particular situation, and a concrete reason why THIS one, not something else.{previous_instruction}
 
Return a JSON object with exactly these four keys:
- current_position: 2-3 honest, specific sentences per point 1 above
- compounding_connections: an array of 0-3 strings, each describing one real, specific compounding relationship you found (empty array if genuinely none exist - do not force one)
- has_genuine_compounding: true only if compounding_connections is non-empty and each entry describes a real, specific, checkable relationship - false if their actions are genuinely disconnected
- next_move: an object with "action" (one specific, concrete thing to do) and "why_this_compounds" (1-2 sentences on why this specific move, given their real situation, builds on what already exists rather than starting a new, disconnected thread){momentum_key_instruction}

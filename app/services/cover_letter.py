"""Cover letter generation - grounded only in the person's real,
existing resume entries and profile, never inventing a connection,
location, or experience they don't actually have.
 
This directly answers a real, documented, verified failure in a
competing product: their cover letter generator produced a line
claiming "your reputation for delivering exceptional commercial
spaces in dynamic markets like Chicago and Phoenix strongly
resonates with my track record" for a person with no track record
in commercial real estate and no connection to either city. That's
not a hypothetical risk - it's a confirmed, reported output.
 
Mirrors generate_resume_summary's exact two-layer discipline: prompt
instructions telling the model not to invent things, plus a second,
independent, deterministic check afterward that doesn't just trust
the prompt worked. _find_fabricated_numbers already catches invented
metrics; _find_unverifiable_claims below is a genuinely different,
complementary check for the specific failure mode above - an invented
place, market, or specific claim that appears nowhere in the
person's real, actual source material.

    name is deliberately excluded, since naming the real company

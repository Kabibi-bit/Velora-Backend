"""School knowledge base + admissions-advice tailoring.

The backend mirror of the frontend school KB (velora/state.js). Holds the
curated, source-verified profiles for the US T30 + top UK universities -
each with its real motto, what it values, tailored guidance, and a
"what accepted students actually did" pattern - plus the logic that
tailors advice to a student's specific target schools.

Honesty rules carried over from the frontend, deliberately:
- Data is curated and source-verified, NOT generated per-request, so
  there are no hallucinated mottos, acceptance rates, or admit patterns.
- UK schools use the real UK course-specific academic model, which is
  genuinely different from the US holistic model - never a US copy.
- Nothing here promises admission; guidance is school-general and honest.
- Schools NOT in this curated set get an explicit "general guidance"
  fallback rather than fabricated school-specific claims.

Keep this file in sync with velora/state.js SCHOOLS. If you change one,
change the other - a drift test in the test suite guards this.

What separates admits is a genuine, deep \"spike\" (a demonstrated, exceptional strength in one area) plus evidence you affect the people around you. Its motto \"Veritas\" rewards intellectual honesty and real curiosity - reference the value through your own experience, never by name-dropping.",
        "acceptedPattern": "Public analyses of admitted students consistently show a clear spike, usually built from extracurriculars and honors rather than coursework - e.g. an admit who progressed over four years from environmental-club member to regional coordinator, showing rising responsibility and measurable impact. The recurring pattern: sustained depth in one or two things, framed around real, quantifiable change - not a long list of shallow memberships."
